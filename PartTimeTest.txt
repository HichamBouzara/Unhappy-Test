hichem, I hope ur doing great, kikim just finished setting up an api just for the test,
 here are the links needed:
https://testfrontforapi.herokuapp.com/api/products?page={numÃ©ro de la page}
https://testfrontforapi.herokuapp.com/api/product/{id_product}

the first is to get a collection of 9 products to show in a single page, 
there are 12 pages in the database, 
the second link is to single out a specific product
using its id, the id used is incremental from 1 I think, the test is to show products 
in a page structure pretty much like google search or better yet ouedkniss, 
and when you click on a product it gives you more details such as a larger picture and 
description, use whatever layout you think is best.
Thank you for doing this bro ðŸ‘Š
